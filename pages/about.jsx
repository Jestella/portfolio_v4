            I am a self-taught front end web developer,
            <br />
            who has a <span>strong passion</span> for building creative websites
            and learning new skills.

          <h3>When it comes to work</h3>
          <p>
            As a firm believer that <span>tenacity and grit</span> are drivers
            of success, I am <span>disciplined and do not give up easily </span>
            on complex or challenging tasks. I approach every single project
            with an <span>ownership mentality</span> and push the limits to get
            things done.
          </p>
          <h3>Outside of work</h3>
          <p>
            When I am not staring at my code, I walk or bike around the city,
            pet someone elseâ€™s dog and watch sunsets.
